My name is Sivakrishna Kakarla. I've finished Masters in Computer Science in 2016.
I started my career as a Test Engioneer then adapted to SQL and now learning and working as a Power BI Developer.
I'm enjoying working with data, visualizing, finding insights and telling a story.

I found working with data is interesting and exciting, everytime working with new data, new insights to find and there's new story to tell....
